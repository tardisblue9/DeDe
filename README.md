# DeDe
## Repository of paper 'DeDe: Detecting Backdoor Samples for SSL Encoders via Decoders' -- CVPR 2025

To run comparisons, you will need to download [DRUPE](https://github.com/Gwinhen/DRUPE), [DECREE](https://github.com/GiantSeaweed/DECREE), [CTRL](https://github.com/meet-cjli/CTRL), [BadCLIP](https://github.com/LiangSiyuan21/BadCLIP), [ASSET](https://github.com/reds-lab/ASSET) from their public repositories respectively. BTW, BadEncoder is implemented by DRUPE. 

You can choose to train your own victim encoder or download it from the above-mentioned repositories. DeDe is non-invasive in both phases of training and testing, but you may need to try different parameters to get the best results. 
We provide a victim encoder trained by DRUPE and a DeDe model in the following links: TODO (uploading).
