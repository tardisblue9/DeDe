# DeDe
Repository of paper 'DeDe: Detecting Backdoor Samples for SSL Encoders via Decoders'

To run comparisons, you will need to download DRUPE, DECREE, CTRL, BadCLIP, ASSET from their public repositories respectively. BadEncoder is implemented by DRUPE. 

You can choose to train your own victim encoder or download from above methods repository. DeDe is non-invasive in both phase of training and testing, but you may need to try different parameters to get the best results.
